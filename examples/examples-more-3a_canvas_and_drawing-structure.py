# Canvas and Drawing
# Structure


# The draw handler allows the user to draw things on the 
#	canvas. Make sure you read all the way to the end of the
#	program to find out how to register a function as the
#	draw handler.

import simplegui

# The draw method is a type of event handler. It takes 
#	exactly one parameter, commonly called the canvas. The
#	canvas can be passed as a parameter to other methods, 
#	if needed.
        
def draw(canvas):
    # The draw handler runs about 60 times each second.
    # Uncomment the next line to see.
    #print "hi"
    
    # Text can also be drawn on the canvas using the 
    #	draw_text() method of the canvas.
    message = "Hello awesome person!"
    point = (50, 100) # The point is the lower left-hand corner of the text
    text_size = 20
    color = "Lime"
    canvas.draw_text(message, point, text_size, color)
    canvas.draw_text('How are you today?', (150, 200), 30, "Magenta")
    
    # Notice that the first coordinate of the point gets bigger
    #	as you go to the right, and the second coordinate of
    #	the point gets bigger as you go down.
    canvas.draw_text("Hi", (25, 225), 20, "Red")
    canvas.draw_text("Hi", (75, 225), 20, "Blue")
    canvas.draw_text("Hi", (25, 275), 20, "Yellow")
    canvas.draw_text("Hi", (75, 275), 20, "Green")
    
    # Text can also go off the screen
    canvas.draw_text("You are so nice!      Omg she's so annoying...", (300, 50), 20, "Silver")
