# Buttons
# Prize Boxes


# This is a sample program that allows a user to play a simple
#	carnival game. The user starts by picking one of three
#	boxes. The computer (or whoever is running the game) then
#	reveals the contents of one of the boxes the user did
#	not pick (which never reveals the prize). The user can 
#	then switch boxes if they would like, and the content 
#	of their box is then revealed.

#	will actually be player_choice + 1 and revealed + 1
