# Logic and Comparisons
# Expressions


# The comparison operations can be used at the same time as
#	the logic operations. The comparison operations are after
#	'not,' but before 'and' in the order of operations.

print "Ex. 4:", x == y and x > 0
print "Ex. 5:", x != y and x > 7
print "Ex. 6:", not b and x > 1


print "--------"
# For fun: you can combine boolean operations with '==' and
#	'<' to make all of the other comparison operations. Feel
#	free to change the numbers to test them out. See if you
#	can come up with alternate ways!
