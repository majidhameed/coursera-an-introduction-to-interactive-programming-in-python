# Functions - take an input(s) and return an output
# Uses


# The main purpose of a function is to do something that 
#	needs to be done multiple times. This saves you the 
#	need to code the same statements over and over in your
#	programs.

# Functions frequently use parameters to obtain information
#	from the regular program, then perform operations on the
#	given info. Parameters can be object, including numbers,
#	strings, and booleans.

# If you would like to use a function to make a computation
#	or do something else, but you do not want to print the
#	outcome to the screen until later, you can use a return
#	statement.

# Return statements can return expressions, and print
#	statements can directly print out the returned values
#	of functions. This can save you from having to make too
#	many unnecessary variables.

# Be careful when attempting to print the value of a function

# Things can get weird when you attempt to print a function
#	that already has print statements.

def other_new_function():
    print "HELLO"
    
print "Start", other_new_function(), "Stop"

# What happened was: the computer printed "Start", then
#	called the method other_new_function() which printed 
#	"HELLO" and started a new line, then attempted to print
#	the value returned by other_new_function() (there wasn't
#	one), and finally printed off the "Stop" at the end of
#	the statement.
