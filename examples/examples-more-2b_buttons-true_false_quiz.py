# True / False Quiz


# This is a sample program that creates a simple 5 question
#	True / False quiz. You can change the number and type
#	of questions to create your own!
# Note: This is not the most efficient way to design this
#	program. A better implementation uses lists, but we 
#	haven't learned about those yet. Watch for an improved
#	version of this program in week 4!
