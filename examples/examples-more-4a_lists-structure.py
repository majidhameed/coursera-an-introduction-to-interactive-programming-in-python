# Lists
# Structure


# Lists are groups of things in some order. List are defined
#	using brackets. Lists can contain any type of object, but
#	in general all objects in a list are of the same type.
#	We have actually already used lists to draw groups of
#	lines and points in a canvas.

# Strings and lists have a lot in common. You can find the 
#	number of elements in a list using the len(list) method.
#   Elements of a list can be accessed using brackets in a 
#	similar manner to strings. The same range rules apply: 
#	-len(list) <= i < len(list)

# Unlike strings, you can change the values stored in parts
#	of the list without having to change the entire list.

#	of a list was done. Notice that only one element changes
#	each time; the rest of the list remains the same.

#	They can become 'aliases' of the same list, causing a
#	change to one of them to affect both of them.

# This issue does not exist for things such as strings and numbers

# This can also make functions involving lists more confusing.

# As a final note, there is one function that is quite helpful
#	when creating lists. range(start, stop, step) can be used
#	to create a list of numbers starting at start increasing
#	by step and not including stop. If there are 2 parameters
#	given, step defaults to one. If one parameter is given,
#	start defaults to 0.
