# The Random Module contains many useful functions for 
#	generating random numbers. To use the Random Module,
#	it must be imported first.

import random

# Here are some examples of how to use the functions in the
#	Random Module. Run the program multiple times to see
#	what different random numbers you can get. Check the 
#	documentation for explanations of how the functions work,
#	and for more functions 

# random.choice(list)
# Returns a random value from the list or a random character
#	of a string

print "Choice 1:", random.choice([1,2,7,18,92])
print "Choice 2:", random.choice(["a","b","yes","no"])
print "Choice 3:", random.choice("alphabet")
# Only allows one parameter
#print "Error:", random.choice("hi", "hello")
# Parameter must be a list
#print "Error:", random.choice(4)
print

# random.randint(a, b)
# Returns an int from a to b inclusive

print "Randint 1:", random.randint(1,10)
print "Randint 2:", random.randint(-5, 27)
# Requires two parameters
#print "Error:", random.randint(4)
# Parameters must be integers
#print "Error:", random.randint(0, 4.5)
print

# random.randrange([start], stop[, step])
# Note: parameters in brackets are optional
# Returns an integer from start (inclusive) to stop (not
#	included), skipping numbers by step. If step is not
#	specified (only two parameters), it defaults to 1. If
#	start is also omitted (only one parameter), it defaults
#	to 0.

# Returns odd numbers from [1,9) (1 being the first number 
#	included in the range, and 9 being the first number 
#	excluded in the range)
print "Randrange 1:", random.randrange(1, 9, 2)
# Returns multiples of 5 from 0 to 50
print "Randrange 2:", random.randrange(0, 51, 5)
# Returns ints form [3,10)
print "Randrange 3:", random.randrange(3, 10)
# Returns positive ints less than 200, including 0
print "Randrange 4:", random.randrange(200)
# Returns negative ints greater than -10, including 0
print "Randrange 5:", random.randrange(-10)

# Requires 1, 2, or 3 parameters
#print "Error:", random.randrange()
#print "Error:", random.randrange(1, 2, 3, 4)
# Parameters must be integers
#print "Error:", random.randrange("hi", 4, 5)
#print "Error:", random.randrange(2, 5, .5)
# Stop must be greater than start if both are given
#print "Error:", random.randrange(5, 3, 6)

# Note: if only two arguments are specified, they are 
#	automatically start and stop. It is impossible to specify
#	step without start as well, although start can be set to
#	zero to achieve the same effect. 

# Trying to count by 2 from 0 to 10, including 10
# Doesn't work

# Returns a random number between 0 and 1, including 0
