# Logic and Comparisons
# if-elif-else


# You can control which statements of your program execute
#	using if, elif, and else statements. They consist of the
#	keywords if, elif (else-if), or else, a boolean or boolean 
#	expression (for if and elif), a colon, and then some 
#	code in the body

# Change the values of the following variables to see how they
#	affect which statements are printed.

    print "so these statements were printed."

    print "so these statements were printed instead."

# An 'if' statement can be followed by any number of 'elif'
#	statements, followed by 0 or 1 'else' statement. 'if' 
#	statements can also be followed by other 'if' statements
