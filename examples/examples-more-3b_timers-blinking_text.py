# Timers
# Blinking Text


# This program is similar to the example "screensaver" shown
#	in the video. In this program, the user's text blinks
#	every time the timer handler is called. Try changing 
#	the timer frequency to see what happens. Notice that if
#	the text is too long not all of it will be shown. For an
#	added challenge, can you come up with a way to solve
#	that issue?
