# Motion
# Ball Track


# This is a simple game to see how many times the user can 
#	guide a ball around a track using the arrow keys to 
#	control the ball's velocity. If you would like an added
#	challenge, you can try to improve the code to time and 
#	display the user's fastest lap.
# Note: Using global variables is very useful when you would
#	like to change aspects of your program. Because ball_radius
#	and the track radii are global variables and all of the 
#	necessary calculations were done based on these variables,
#	you can change the track width or ball size to increase
#	or decrease the difficulty of the game.
