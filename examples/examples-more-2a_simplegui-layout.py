# SimpleGUI
# Layout


# For this program, just run it. Don't worry about the code,
#	we haven't learned how to use it yet. Make sure you can
#	identify all of the parts and what they are used for.
#	Note that the status area will only update if you click
#	inside of the canvas.





































# Fine. Look at the code then. I'm not explaining it yet
#	though.
# I suppose you can learn from messing around with it and 
#	changing things if you are that dedicated.
