# Lists
# Tuples


# Tuples are groups of things in some order. They function 
#	in a way very similar to lists, except that once they 
#	are defined, they cannot be changed (like strings).

print "Ex. 1:", ("This", "is", "a", "tuple")
print "Ex. 2:", (2, 3, 4)
print "Ex. 3:", (True, False)
# Tuples of tuples
print "Ex. 5:", ((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))
print "Ex. 6:", (("a", "a", "a"), ("b", "c", "d"))
# Tuples of lists

# You can find the number of elements in a list using the 
#	len() method. Elements of a tuple can be accessed using 
#	brackets.

t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
print "Ex. 7:", len(t)
print "Ex. 8:", t[0]

print "Ex. 10:", t[3]
print "Ex. 11:", t[-5]
#print "Error:", t[5]
#print "Error:", t[-6]

# The notation is similar for accessing sub-tuples

print "Ex. 12:", t[0][1]
print "Ex. 13:", t[2][0]
print "Ex. 14:", len(t)

# It is also possible to take a sub-tuple of the tuple 
#	using the same syntax that we used for strings.
# Note: start is the first one you include, stop is the
#	first one you exclude.

t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')

print "Ex. 17:", t[2:4]
print "Ex. 18:", t[0:len(t)]
#print "Error:", t[0:6]
#print "Error:", t[0,5]
print

# Unlike lists, you cannot change the values stored in parts
#	of the tuple without changing the entire tuple.

t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
#t[2] = 'z'
