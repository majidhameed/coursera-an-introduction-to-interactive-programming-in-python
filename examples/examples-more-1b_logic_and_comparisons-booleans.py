# Logic and Comparisons
# Booleans


# Booleans are a value that can either be 'True' or 'False'.
#	Note that the color of the words is different.

print True

# Booleans can also be stored in variables

print "--------"
# The operators 'and', 'or', and 'not' can be used to evaluate
#	a boolean expression.

# 'and' is true only if both operands are true
print "True and True:", True and True
print "True and False:", True and False
print "False and True:", False and True
print "False and False:", False and False

# 'or' is true if either operand is true
print "True or True:", True or True
print "True or False:", True or False
print "False or True:", False or True
print "False or False:", False or False

# 'not' only requires one operand, and it returns True if it
#	is False, and False if it is True
print "not True:", not True
print "not False:", not False

# Variables can also store the results of these operations
