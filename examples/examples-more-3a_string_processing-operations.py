# String Processing
# Operations


# There are many additional functions that are helpful when
#	dealing with strings. This program will highlight some
#	of the most useful ones. For the complete list, check
#	the docs.

# It is possible to 'add' strings together using the '+'
#	operator. This is called concatenation. It combines the
#	string operands into a single string. Note that no space
#	appears between the two operands in the new string.

a = "air"
b = "plane"
print "Ex. 1:", a + b
print "Ex. 2:", 'The' + "m"
print "Ex. 3:", 'Hello' + ' ' + '!'

# This can be useful when you would like to use both " and
#	' inside of a string.

a = "I really like how Calvin's "
b = 'scarf is "in" right now.'
print "Ex. 4:", a + b
print

# It can also be helpful to be able to find a specific letter
#	or character in a string. This is done with the syntax
#	string[index]. Note that the first character of a string
#	is at index 0, and the indexes end at one less than the
#	length of the string. The string must have at least one
#	character to use this at all.

a = "1234567"
b = "01234567"
c = ""
print "Ex. 5:", a[0]
print "Ex. 6:", b[0]
print "Ex. 7:", a[5]
print "Ex. 8:", b[7]
#print "Error:", a[7]
#print "Error:", b[400]
#print "Error:", c[0]
print

# The index can also be negative. This returns characters
#	from the end of the list instead. index = -1 returns
#	the last character, while index = -length returns the 
#	first character. If index < -length, an error occurs.
#	Index must be an integer.

print "Ex. 9:", a[-1]
print "Ex. 10:", b[-1]
print "Ex. 11:", a[-7]
print "Ex. 12:", b[-5]
print "Ex. 13:", b[-8]
#print "Error:", a[-8]
#print "Error:", b[-60]
#print "Error:", a[5.5]
print

# The function len(string) returns the number of characters
#	in a string. This can be very helpful in avoiding errors
#	caused by trying to find a character that doesn't exist
#	and for finding the last character of a string without
#	using a negative index. Note that len() shows up in a 
#	different color, just like min() and max().

a = "ABCDE"
print "Ex. 14:", len(a)
print "Ex. 15:", a[len(a) - 1]
print "Ex. 16:", a[-len(a)]
#print "Error:", a[len(a)]
print "Ex. 17:", a[len(a) // 2]
#print "Error", a[len(a) / 2]

# It is also possible to take a 'substring' of the full
#	string, or 'slice' it into parts. This is done with
#	similar syntax: string[start:stop], where start and stop
#	are both integers. Remember the colon in between them!
# Note: start is the first one you include, stop is the
#	first one you exclude.

a = "123 ABC"
print "Ex. 18:", a[0:3]
print "Ex. 19:", a[4:8]
print "Ex. 20:", a[2:6]
print "Ex. 21:", a[0:len(a)]
#print "Error:", a[0,5]
print

# Note: You actually only need either start or stop if you
#	want to start at the beginning or stop at the end.

print "Ex. 22:", a[:5]
print "Ex. 23:", a[1:]
# Note: While valid, this is completely pointless
print "Ex. 24:", a[:]
print

# A few more:
# string.lower() returns the string in all lowercase letters.
#	It does not change the original string, nor does it
#	change non-letters. string.upper() does the opposite. You
#	usually only need to use one.

a = "Hi PeoPle"
print "Ex. 25:", a.lower()
print "Ex. 26:", a.upper()
print "Ex. 27:", a
print

# string.isdigit() returns True if the string can be converted
#	to an integer, and False if it can't.

a = "123"
b = "1.23"
c = "1.two"

print "Ex. 28:", a.isdigit()
print "Ex. 29:", b.isdigit()
print "Ex. 30:", c.isdigit()
