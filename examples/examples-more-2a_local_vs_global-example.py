# Local vs. Global Variables
# Example

# For this example, there are five versions of the same 
#	program. Three of them work and two of them don't. The
#	goal of the program is to move an object along a number
#	line using a move method, keep track of its location 
#	with the variable loc, and calculate the displacement
#	(always positive) from its starting location with the 
#	displacement method.

# Version one: Doesn't work. The move method throws an error,
#	while the displacement method always prints 0 because
#	the location never changes.

start = 1
loc = start

def move(x):
    loc = loc + x

def displacement():
    return abs(loc - start)

#move(3)
print "Version 1:", displacement()
#move(-2)
print "Version 1:", displacement()
print

# Version two: Works. Fixes version one by declaring variables
#	global at the start of the move method. No global
#	declaration is needed at the start of the displacement
#	method because the values in the global variables loc 
#	and start are not changing.

start = 1
loc = start

def move(x):
    global loc
    loc = loc + x

def displacement():
    return abs(loc - start)

move(3)
print "Version 2:", displacement()
move(-2)
print "Version 2:", displacement()
print

# Version three: Also works. This one returns values instead
#	of attempting to override the global variable. Notice 
#	that the new local variable must have a different name.
#	Notice also that we must assign loc to the value returned
#	by the move method.

start = 1
loc = start

def move(x):
    pos = loc + x
    return pos

def displacement():
    return abs(loc - start)

loc = move(3)
print "Version 3:", displacement()
loc = move(-2)
print "Version 3:", displacement()
print

# Version Four: This one does not work. The loc that is 
#	a parameter in the move method is actually a local 
#	variable instead of a global one, and therefore the 
#	value of the global loc does not change.

start = 1
loc = start

def move(x, loc):
    loc += x
    return loc

def displacement():
    return abs(loc - start)

move(3, loc)
print "Version 4:", displacement()
move(-2, loc)
print "Version 4:", displacement()
print


# Version Five: This one fixes the problem from version 
#	four. This one passes the method the value of loc as a 
#	parameter, and returns the value of the new loc. Note 
#	that in this example the local variable shares the same
#	name as the global one, but is not actually the same 
#	thing.

start = 1
loc = start

def move(x, loc):
    loc += x
    return loc

def displacement():
    return abs(loc - start)

loc = move(3, loc)
print "Version 5:", displacement()
loc = move(-2, loc)
print "Version 5:", displacement()
print
