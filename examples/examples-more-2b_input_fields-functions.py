# Input Fields
# Functions


# Input fields can be used to call functions multiple times
#	while the program is running. Here are functions from
#	week one that can now be called using input fields.
#	There is a difference: input fields always return strings,
#	but the methods require numbers. This is solved using the
#	int() and float() methods.
# Remember to hit 'enter' after typing data into the input
#	fields to give it to the computor. Be careful! If you
#	enter the wrong type of data, an error can occur.
